  - prompt: Here are some biomes from an algebraic query over the Environment Ontology. There's no header line.

  - prompt: Here are the EnvO biomes that are included in my project's soil biome enumeration. A header line is included.

  - prompt: Here is a table of relationships between the Environment Ontology biomes and other classes.
      Subclass relationships are transitive.
    file: local/biome-relationships.csv
question: How many biomes are there in the algebraic set? How many biomes are included in the enumeration?
  Which biomes (and how many) are in the algebraic set but not in the enumeration, and vice versa?

#  Whats the mean and the standard deviation of lengths of the biome labels from the enumeration,
#  and the lengths of the enum-excluded biome labels?
