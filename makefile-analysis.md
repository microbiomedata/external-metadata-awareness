1. Missing Prerequisites for Multiple Targets

In nmdc_schema.Makefile, there are several targets with prerequisites that are not generated by any rule:

- local/EnvBroadScaleSoilEnum-pvs-keys-parsed.csv
- local/EnvLocalScaleSoilEnum-pvs-keys-parsed.csv
- local/EnvMediumSoilEnum-pvs-keys-parsed.csv

These are required for creating their respective -unique.csv files, but there's no rule to generate them.

2. Missing Files for unused-terrestrial-biomes-prompt.txt

In envo.Makefile, the rule for local/unused-terrestrial-biomes-prompt.txt depends on:

- local/biome-relationships.csv - This file isn't generated by any rule (only .tsv version exists)
- local/EnvBroadScaleSoilEnum-pvs-keys-parsed-unique.csv - Has prerequisite issues noted above

3. Unusable MongoDB Targets

In ncbi_metadata.Makefile, several targets depend on a MongoDB setup:

- load-biosamples-into-mongo
- add-ncbi-biosample-package-attributes
- add-ncbi-biosamples-xml-download-date
- infer-env-triad-curies

These commands use MongoDB variables that may not be set by default for new users.

4. Large Data Download Requirements

Several targets require downloading massive files:

- downloads/biosample_set.xml.gz (~3GB)
- downloads/bioproject.xml (~3GB)
- local/biosample_set.xml (uncompressed XML, ~121GB based on directory listing)

These might be impractical for casual use or testing.

5. NMDC Credentials Required

In nmdc_metadata.Makefile, the target downloads/nmdc_select_mongodb_dump.gz requires:

- SSH tunnel to NMDC MongoDB
- NERSC credentials
- NMDC MongoDB credentials (NMDC_MONGO_USER and NMDC_MONGO_PASSWORD)

6. Missing Local Directory Structure

The Makefiles assume a local/ directory structure that might not exist for new users. Some files that should be created
by the Makefiles already exist, but others don't, creating inconsistent prerequisites.

7. Potentially Unused Outputs

Several targets appear to be exploratory and don't feed into other processes:

- Most visualization outputs like local/aquatic-biome.png and local/EnvBroadScaleSoilEnum.png
- Analysis outputs like various .info.txt files
- Intermediary files like local/biosample-last-id-xml.txt

8. Commented-Out Targets

In ncbi_metadata.Makefile, there are commented-out targets and prerequisites that suggest incomplete or deprecated
functionality:
#downloads/ncbi-biosample-packages.xml:

# date

# $(WGET) -O $@ "https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/docs/packages/?format=xml"

# date

9. Hidden/Development Features

There are many TODO comments and notes about experimental features:

- "# todo what cpu/ram resources are really required?"
- "# use runoak cache-ls to see where the SQLite files are cached"
- "# ~ 15 minutes with envo and po. add bto and uberon: ~ 70 minutes. still running after 24 hours with NCBITaxon."

Summary

The most significant issues are:

1. The dependency chain in nmdc_schema.Makefile with missing prerequisites for the *-parsed.csv files
2. The requirement for large data downloads and specific MongoDB setup
3. Dependencies on external credentials for NMDC data
4. The biome-relationships.csv file required by envo.Makefile but not generated

These issues would make it difficult for a new user to successfully run many of the Makefile targets without significant
manual intervention or modification.

1. Performance & Resource Requirements

- Hardware Considerations:
    - "todo what cpu/ram resources are really required? 4 cores and 128 gb ram in ec2 was probably excessive"
    - "32 gb 2020 macbook pro complains about swapping while running this code if many other 'medium' apps are running"
    - "18GB RAM used; no swapping"
    - "1 core in use @ 1 to 3 GHz out of 4.7 GHz max"
- Processing Times:
    - "wget 2 minutes on MAM Ubuntu NUC"
    - "unzip 9 minutes on MAM Ubuntu NUC"
    - "1% MongoDB load 8 minutes on MAM Ubuntu NUC"
    - "~ 15 minutes with envo and po. add bto and uberon: ~ 70 minutes. still running after 24 hours with NCBITaxon"
    - "Completed processing 30 files in 1935.58 minutes. Total inserted: 35567948 records"
- Processing Rates:
    - "~ 14k biosamples/minute"
    - "800/hour?"
    - "20 million/day?"

2. Data Size & Formatting

- File Sizes:
    - "biosample_set.xml.gz # ~ 3 GB August 2024"
    - "bioproject.xml # ~ 3 GB March 2025"
- Data Format Limitations:
    - "getting fragments of EnvO because the whole thing is too large to feed into an LLM"
    - "getting fragments of MIxS because the whole thing is too large to feed into an LLM"
    - "--output-type tsv has lots of info but wrapped in square brackets"

3. Development TODOs & Technical Debt

- Infrastructure Improvements:
    - "todo switch to more consistent mongodb connection strings"
    - "todo warn about conflicting duckdb locks even when both processes are just reading"
    - "todo add a count from duckdb step"
    - "todo return to generating a wide table?"
    - "todo reassess duckdb table names"
- Code Organization:
    - "todo add poetry CLI aliases for python scripts"
    - "todo log don't print"
    - "todo curies_asserted and curies_ner have inconsistent casing for their prefix columns"
- Future Enhancements:
    - "todo (long term) annotate with more ontologies. uberon is slow. ncbitaxon might take days with this
      implementation"
    - "todo parameterize annotation ontologies in new re-annotator script"
    - "todo add ranking of re-annotation predicates and prefixes"
    - "todo add all labels table? or include label in annotation results?"
- Documentation Needs:
    - "todo update dev and user documentation; share database and documentation at NERSC portal"
    - "document limitations of using DBeaver with large DuckDBs"
    - "document paths not included in duckdb"
- Path or Environment Issues:
    - "todo may need to fix .env path" (appears multiple times)
    - "todo may want to change requests cache location"

4. Technical Guidelines & Best Practices

- Data Guidelines:
    - "our guideline is that env_broad_scale should be answered with an EnvO biome subclass"
    - "our guideline is that env_medium should be answered with an EnvO biome subclass"
- Tool Usage:
    - "use runoak cache-ls to see where the SQLite files are cached"
    - "these OAK commands fetch the latest EnvO SQLite file from a BBOP S3 bucket"
    - "it may be a few days behind the envo.owl file form the EnvO GH repo"

5. Commented-Out Code & Alternatives

- Disabled Code:
    - Multiple lines of commented MongoDB collection exclusions
    - Commented-out download commands
- Alternative Approaches:
    - "find code for converting to table in other repos or convert to duckdb"
    - "preferable to use a tagged release, but theres good stuff in this commit that hasn't been released yet"
    - "cborg/claude-opus" (reference to an alternative model)

1. XML Path Analysis Tool: count_xml_paths.py

Purpose: Counts occurrences of each unique XPath in an XML file

Key Features:

- Memory-efficient streaming processing using lxml.etree.iterparse
- Periodic status reporting during processing
- Ability to stop after a certain number of occurrences
- Tracks attributes and text content
- Outputs results in both formatted text and JSON format

Usage Example:
poetry run count-xml-paths \
--xml-file downloads/bioproject.xml \
--interval 10 \
--always-count-path '/PackageSet/Package/Project' \
--stop-after 999999999 \
--output local/bioproject_xpath_counts.json

The Makefiles make use of this tool, especially in ncbi_metadata.Makefile:

local/bioproject_xpath_counts.json: downloads/bioproject.xml
poetry run python external_metadata_awareness/count_xml_paths.py \
--xml-file $< \
--interval 10 \
--always-count-path '/PackageSet/Package/Project' \
--stop-after 999999999 \
--output $@

Practical Applications

- Schema Understanding: This tool helps discover the structure of XML data without relying on explicit schema documentation
- Dataset Exploration: The XML path analysis tool helps understand new datasets before full processing
- Subset Selection: Understanding path distribution helps select relevant subsets of data
