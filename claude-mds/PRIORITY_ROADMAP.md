# Repository Alignment & Priority Roadmap

**Generated**: 2025-10-02
**Purpose**: Align issues, documentation, and code; provide clear next-step priorities

---

## Executive Summary

This repository has **46 open issues** spanning 14 months (Aug 2024 - Oct 2025). After auditing all empty and short-body issues, here's a framework for deciding what to work on next.

### Current State Assessment

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Core functionality working: biosample normalization (#214-221 closed)
- ✅ DuckDB export pipeline functional (PR #32 merged)
- ✅ MongoDB collections populated and indexed
- ✅ Environmental context voting sheets generated
- ✅ Issues now have context (just added to 18 issues today)

**Gaps:**
- ❌ Missing semantic similarity functionality (#11, #13, #21)
- ❌ No EBI/ENA integration (#1)
- ❌ Stale/missing files referenced in issues (#18, #21, #114)
- ❌ Inconsistent MongoDB connection patterns (#176)
- ❌ No automated data refresh strategy (#63, #64)

## Issue Categorization Framework

### Category 1: IMMEDIATE - Active Work Threads ⚡
*Issues directly connected to recently merged work or blocking current workflows*

| Issue | Title | Why Immediate | Effort |
|-------|-------|---------------|--------|
| #216 | Integrate date/coordinate normalization into MongoDB biosample flattening pipeline | Extends just-completed normalization work (#214-215) | Medium |
| #218 | Handle date ranges and multi-value collection dates | Known limitation from #214 work | Small |
| #219 | Investigate biosamples with missing collection_date | Data quality issue discovered in #214 | Small |
| #220 | Add lat_lon requirement to future biosample flattening/normalization pipelines | Architectural decision from #214 | Small |
| #221 | Define timezone handling strategy | Documented limitation from #214, needs resolution | Small |

**Suggested Action**: Complete the normalization work cluster. Total effort ~2-3 weeks.

---

### Category 2: INFRASTRUCTURE - Foundation Issues 🏗️
*Technical debt and consistency problems affecting multiple workflows*

| Issue | Title | Why Important | Effort | Blockers |
|-------|-------|---------------|--------|----------|
| #176 | Unified strategy for caching study, biosample, etc. metadata in MongoDB | Affects every MongoDB script | Large | None |
| #203 | Replace print() statements with proper logging | Code quality, debugging | Medium | None |
| #202 | Add code quality standards and automated checks | Prevents regressions | Medium | None |
| #63 | Strategy for keeping supplementary MongoDB collections up to date | Data freshness | Medium | #176 |
| #64 | Strategy for keeping Biosample DuckDB up to date | Data freshness | Medium | #176 |
| #183 | Document the process of loading this repo's MongoDB from scratch | Reproducibility | Small | #176 |

**Suggested Action**: Tackle #176 first (MongoDB connection unification), then #203 (logging), then automated refresh strategies.

---

### Category 3: FEATURE REQUESTS - Enhancement Opportunities 🎯
*New capabilities that extend functionality*

| Issue | Title | Priority | Rationale |
|-------|-------|----------|-----------|
| #159 | Add tqdm to new_bioportal_curie_mapper.py | HIGH | User experience, quick win |
| #62 | Index more fields in supplementary MongoDB | MEDIUM | Query performance |
| #200 | Add CSV export functionality for flattened GOLD collections | MEDIUM | Data accessibility |
| #1 | Load EBI/ENA biosample metadata specifications | LOW | Major scope expansion |
| #68 | Regenerate Simon's SRA wishlist | LOW | One-off analysis task |

**Suggested Action**: Quick wins first (#159), then performance (#62), defer scope expansions (#1).

---

### Category 4: RESEARCH QUESTIONS - Needs Investigation 🔬
*Issues requiring analysis before implementation*

| Issue | Title | Action Needed |
|-------|-------|---------------|
| #156 | Obsolete flag not present in some annotations | Verify if still occurring, create test cases |
| #157 | Ignore some annotations like ENVO 'gut' | Define semantic filtering criteria |
| #158 | OAK annotate text configuration for whole words | Create gold-standard test set, measure sensitivity/specificity |
| #11, #13, #21 | Semantic similarity functionality | Research requirements, evaluate libraries (OAK semsim, embeddings) |
| #12 | Review anthropogenic classes in env_local_scale | Domain expert review needed (@sierra-moxon @cmungall) |

**Suggested Action**: These need requirements gathering before coding. Consider creating RFCs or design docs.

---

### Category 5: DOCUMENTATION DEBT - Knowledge Capture 📚
*Missing or outdated documentation*

| Issue | Title | Complexity |
|-------|-------|------------|
| #191 | Document measurement analysis on NCBI Biosamples | Medium |
| #194 | Document measurement analysis (for UCUM alignment) for all sources | Medium |
| #204 | Document using DuckDB with SRA metadata parquet files | Small |
| #42 | Review dependencies and update documentation | Small |

**Suggested Action**: Low-hanging fruit - #204 and #42 can be done quickly.

---

### Category 6: STALE/QUESTIONABLE - May Close 🗑️
*Issues that may no longer be relevant*

| Issue | Title | Reason |
|-------|-------|--------|
| #18 | jaccard_distance in file doesn't look right | File doesn't exist |
| #40 | See followup actions from PR #32 | PR merged, no specific actions listed |
| #25 | Some scripts still access Biosample PostgreSQL | PostgreSQL deprecated |
| #132 | Some mixs preferred unit annotations are blank | host_common_name/samp_name aren't measurements |

**Suggested Action**: Review with stakeholders, likely close most of these.

## Repository Health Metrics

**Issues**: 46 open (now all with context)
**Python Scripts**: 54 files
**Makefiles**: 4 with TODOs
**Documentation**: 60+ markdown files (some redundant)
**Recent Activity**: High (10 issues created in past week)

**Recommendation**: Focus on **completion over addition**. The repository has strong foundations but needs consolidation.

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review this roadmap** - Does the categorization align with your priorities?
2. **Pick a phase** - Which phase (1-4) matches your current goals?
3. **Start small** - Begin with Phase 1 or quick wins (#159, #204, #42)
4. **Close stale issues** - Review Category 6 for candidates
5. **Create tracking issue** - Consider a meta-issue to track Phase 1 progress

## Files That Could Be Consolidated/Archived

**Root directory** has 6 MD files - consider moving to `/docs`:
- architectural-pattern-inconsistency-analysis.md
- bioproject_metadata_completeness_analysis.md
- ncbi-duckdb-export-summary-2025-09-30.md
- September-2025-Biosample-DuckDB-documentation.md
- CLEANUP_NEEDED.md (meta!)

**claude-mds/** has 30+ session summaries - consider archiving older ones

**unorganized/** directory - as the name suggests, needs organization
