# Claude Overnight Skip Analysis - 2025-09-29

## Analysis Summary
Performed comprehensive data-driven analysis to identify additional harmonized_names to skip based on multiple criteria. **Note: These are Claude's overnight recommendations, separate from the collaborative MAM+Claude skip list.**

## Analysis Methods Used

### 1. Categorical Value Detection
Fields with <50 unique values despite >100 biosamples (highly categorical):
- investigation_type, host_sex, sex, rel_to_oxygen, biotic_relationship, light_type, space_typ_state
- diether_lipids, bishomohopanol, glucosidase_act, building_setting, heat_cool_type, special_diet
- drainage_class, indoor_space, mean_peak_frict_vel, mean_frict_vel, filter_type, soil_horizon

### 2. Multiple Quantulum3 Outputs (User flagged as suspicious)
Fields with many content values producing multiple quantulum3 outputs:
- lat_lon (64,179 multi-output pairs) - coordinate parsing issues
- env_medium (985), collection_date (926), env_local_scale (711)
- description (364), soil_text_measure (318), isolation_source (232)

### 3. Zero Parse Success Rate
Fields with 0% quantulum3 success despite substantial data:
- basin_name, biotic_relationship, body_habitat, build_occup_type, building_setting
- cur_land_use, diet_last_six_month, dominant_hand, drainage_class, env_package
- field, filter_type, gaseous_environment, host_color, host_sex, host_symbiont

### 4. High Dimensionless Ratio (>90%)
Fields producing mostly dimensionless results (likely IDs/codes, not measurements):
- body_mass_index (100%), omics_observ_id (100%), biol_stat (100%)
- family_id (100%), soil_ph (100%), tot_carb (100%), height_or_length (100%)
- ph (99.5%), collection_date (98.7%), abs_air_humidity (98.4%)

### 5. Single Value Dominance (>50% repetition)
Fields dominated by single repeated values:
- last_clean (100%), molecular_data_type (100%), floor_struc (100%)
- gap_consent_code (100%), area_samp_size (97.3%), sediment_type (94.8%)

## Claude's Additional Skip Recommendations

**High Confidence Skips (data-driven evidence):**
- **Categorical Fields**: investigation_type, host_sex, sex, rel_to_oxygen, biotic_relationship, light_type, space_typ_state, diether_lipids, bishomohopanol, glucosidase_act, building_setting, heat_cool_type, special_diet, drainage_class, indoor_space, filter_type, soil_horizon
- **Zero Parse Success**: basin_name, body_habitat, build_occup_type, cur_land_use, diet_last_six_month, dominant_hand, env_package, field, gaseous_environment, host_color, host_symbiont
- **Dominated by Single Values**: last_clean, molecular_data_type, floor_struc, gap_consent_code, gap_consent_short_name, submitter_handle, gap_accession, biospecimen_repository, forma, sediment_type, particle_class, study_inc_dur, host_cellular_loc, indoor_surf, growth_protocol, food_type_processed, serogroup, analyte_type, type_status, route_transmission, menarche

**Medium Confidence Skips (suspicious patterns):**
- **Multiple Quantulum3 Outputs**: lat_lon, env_medium, collection_date, env_local_scale, description, soil_text_measure, isolation_source
- **High Dimensionless Ratio**: body_mass_index, omics_observ_id, biol_stat, family_id, soil_ph, tot_carb, height_or_length, oxy_stat_samp

## Overlap Analysis
Many of these were already in the collaborative skip list:
- Already skipped: collection_date, env_medium, env_local_scale, description, isolation_source, family_id, omics_observ_id, biol_stat
- New candidates: ~35 additional harmonized_names with strong data-driven evidence

## Total Impact
- Current collaborative skip list: 156 harmonized_names
- Claude's additional recommendations: ~35 harmonized_names
- Combined potential skip list: ~191 harmonized_names
- Remaining for measurement processing: ~504 harmonized_names

## Recommendation
Consider adding the "High Confidence Skips" to the existing skip list, as they have strong data-driven evidence of being non-measurement fields. The "Medium Confidence" fields could be processed but flagged for careful review of results.
