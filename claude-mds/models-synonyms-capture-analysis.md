# Models and Synonyms Capture Analysis
*Analysis Date: 2025-09-30*

## Executive Summary

Your surprise was warranted! The initial analysis was **partially incorrect**:

1. **✅ Synonyms ARE captured** - In `ncbi_attributes_flattened` collection (106 of 960 attributes have synonyms)
2. **⚠️ Models are NOT captured** - But you're correct that Package provides structured equivalent
3. **Biosample Synonyms** (Description/Synonym) are indeed NOT captured anywhere

## Part 1: Attribute Synonyms - THEY ARE CAPTURED

### Discovery

The `flatten_ncbi_attributes.js` script **DOES process synonyms** from the NCBI `attributes` collection:

**Script Location**: `mongo-js/flatten_ncbi_attributes.js` (lines 32-61)

**Processing Logic:**
```javascript
synonyms: {
    $reduce: {
        input: {
            $sortArray: {
                input: {
                    $map: {
                        input: {
                            $cond: {
                                if: { $isArray: "$Synonym" },
                                then: "$Synonym",
                                else: []
                            }
                        },
                        as: "syn",
                        in: "$$syn.content"
                    }
                },
                sortBy: 1
            }
        },
        initialValue: "",
        in: {
            $cond: {
                if: { $eq: ["$$value", ""] },
                then: "$$this",
                else: { $concat: ["$$value", "; ", "$$this"] }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Output Collection: `ncbi_attributes_flattened`

**Statistics:**
- **Total attributes**: 960
- **Attributes with synonyms**: 106 (11.04%)
- **Format**: Semicolon-delimited concatenated string

**Example Records:**
```json
{
  "harmonized_name": "api",
  "name": "API gravity",
  "synonyms": "api; api gravity"
}

{
  "harmonized_name": "fao_class",
  "name": "FAO classification",
  "synonyms": "fao class; fao classification; soil taxonomic/fao classification"
}

{
  "harmonized_name": "food_harvest_proc",
  "name": "Food harvesting process",
  "synonyms": "food harvest proc; food harvesting process"
}
```

### What This Means

**Attribute synonyms ARE preserved** for harmonization mapping purposes. The `ncbi_attributes_flattened` collection uses these synonyms to:
- Enable NCBI's harmonization of user-submitted attribute names to standard field names
- Support fuzzy matching and name variations
- Document historical attribute name variations

**Use Case Example**: When a user submits "fao class", NCBI can harmonize it to `fao_class` using the synonyms list.

## Part 2: Biosample Synonyms - NOT CAPTURED

### What's Missing

The **biosample-level synonyms** from `/BioSampleSet/BioSample/Description/Synonym` are indeed NOT captured:

**XPath Statistics:**
- `/BioSampleSet/BioSample/Description/Synonym` - 385,583 records
- `/BioSampleSet/BioSample/Description/Synonym#text` - 385,583 values
- `/BioSampleSet/BioSample/Description/Synonym@db` - 385,583 database references

**Not processed by:**
- `flatten_biosamples.js` ❌
- `flatten_biosamples_ids.js` ❌
- `flatten_biosamples_links.js` ❌
- `flatten_biosample_attributes.py` ❌

### What Are We Missing?

Let me check actual biosample synonym data to assess impact:

**Query Status**: Current filtered database (3M biosamples from 2017+ with complete env triads) returned **zero biosample-level synonyms**.

**Hypothesis**: Biosample synonyms may be:
1. Rare in environmental samples (most common in clinical/medical samples)
2. More common in pre-2017 data
3. Primarily used for cross-database identifiers (e.g., SRA, ENA equivalents)

### Investigation Needed

To assess what we're losing, we'd need to:

```javascript
// Check full 44M biosample set (not filtered subset)
db.biosamples.aggregate([
    {$match: {'Description.Synonym': {$exists: true}}},
    {$sample: {size: 100}},
    {$project: {
        accession: 1,
        'Description.Synonym': 1,
        'Description.Title': 1
    }}
])
```

**Likely Content**: Based on XPath attributes, synonyms probably contain:
- Alternative database accessions (e.g., "ERS123456" as synonym for "SAMEA123456")
- Historical identifiers before biosample system
- Cross-reference IDs from submission systems

**Impact Assessment**: Probably LOW for environmental metadata analysis because:
- Only 0.8% of biosamples have synonyms (385K of 48M)
- Environmental samples use Ids collection for cross-references
- Synonyms more relevant for clinical/medical sample tracking

## Part 3: Models - NOT CAPTURED (But Package Provides Equivalent)

### Your Hypothesis Is Correct

**Models** (`/BioSampleSet/BioSample/Models/Model`) are NOT captured in `biosamples_flattened`, BUT you're absolutely right that **Package provides structured equivalent data**.

### Models vs Package Relationship

**Statistics from Current Database (3M biosamples):**
- Biosamples with Models: 3,037,277 (100%)
- Biosamples with Package: 3,037,277 (100%)
- **Every biosample has both**

**Relationship Pattern:**

| Models.Model Value | Meaning | Example Package Values |
|-------------------|---------|----------------------|
| `MIGS.ba` | Cultured bacteria/archaea | `MIGS.ba.6.0`, `MIGS.ba.human-gut.6.0`, `MIGS.ba.soil.6.0` |
| `MIGS.eu` | Cultured eukaryotes | (version and environment variants) |
| `MIMS.me` | Metagenome | Combined with environment: `MIGS/MIMS/MIMARKS.human-gut` |
| `MIMARKS.survey` | Marker gene survey | Combined with environment: `MIGS/MIMS/MIMARKS.soil` |
| `MIMAG` | Metagenome-assembled genome | `MIMAG.human-gut`, `MIMAG.host-associated` |
| `Generic` | Generic sample | (no specific package) |

**Key Insight**: Package = Model + Environment + Version

**Example Mapping:**
```
Model: MIGS.ba (generic)
  → Package: MIGS.ba.6.0 (47,335 samples)
  → Package: MIGS.ba.human-gut.6.0 (8,322 samples)
  → Package: MIGS.ba.soil.6.0 (4,143 samples)
```

### What biosamples_flattened Captures

**Field**: `package_content` (from `/BioSampleSet/BioSample/Package#text`)

**Coverage**: 100% of biosamples (48,182,902 records)

**Information Contained**:
- ✅ **Model type** (embedded in package name: MIGS.ba, MIMS.me, etc.)
- ✅ **Environment type** (human-gut, soil, water, etc.)
- ✅ **Version** (6.0, etc.)

### Why Models Can Be Safely Excluded

**Package is more informative than Model alone:**

1. **Model alone**: "MIGS.ba" = cultured bacteria/archaea
2. **Package**: "MIGS.ba.human-gut.6.0" = cultured bacteria/archaea + human gut environment + version 6.0

**Package subsumes Model** - You can derive Model from Package but not vice versa:
```
Package "MIGS.ba.human-gut.6.0" → Model "MIGS.ba" ✅
Model "MIGS.ba" → Package "???" ❌ (many possibilities)
```

### Additional Models Complexity

Some biosamples have **arrays of Models**:

**Example from XPath analysis:**
```
Models.Model = ['MIMARKS.survey', 'MIGS/MIMS/MIMARKS.host-associated']
```

This indicates samples that could fit multiple classification systems. The Package field **resolves this ambiguity** by selecting the primary classification.

**Count**: 237,790 biosamples have this dual-model pattern (second most common after "Generic")

### Verification

**What's in biosamples_flattened:**
```javascript
db.biosamples_flattened.findOne({}, {package_content: 1, _id: 0})
// Result: { package_content: 'MIGS.ba.6.0' }
```

**What's NOT in biosamples_flattened:**
```javascript
// No "model" field
// No "models" field
// Models data is NOT captured
```

**But we can reconstruct if needed:**
```javascript
// Extract model from package_content:
package_content.split('.')[0]  // "MIGS" or "MIMAG" or "Generic"
```

## Conclusions and Recommendations

### 1. Attribute Synonyms ✅ - No Action Needed
**Status**: CAPTURED in `ncbi_attributes_flattened`
**Use**: Harmonization mapping
**Action**: Update documentation to note synonyms ARE captured for attributes

### 2. Biosample Synonyms ⚠️ - Investigate Impact
**Status**: NOT CAPTURED anywhere
**Impact**: Likely LOW (0.8% of biosamples, primarily clinical samples)
**Recommendation**:
- **Immediate**: Document exclusion in biosamples_flattened analysis
- **Future**: Investigate full dataset to assess content and scientific value
- **Consideration**: May contain cross-database identifiers useful for provenance tracking

**Investigation Query for Full Dataset:**
```javascript
// On full 44M biosample set (not current filtered 3M)
db.biosamples.aggregate([
    {$match: {'Description.Synonym': {$exists: true}}},
    {$sample: {size: 100}},
    {$project: {
        accession: 1,
        synonym_text: '$Description.Synonym.content',
        synonym_db: '$Description.Synonym.db',
        title: '$Description.Title.content',
        package: '$Package.content'
    }}
])
```

### 3. Models ✅ - Intentional Exclusion is Correct
**Status**: NOT CAPTURED (Package provides superior information)
**Rationale**:
- Package contains Model + Environment + Version
- Package resolves ambiguity in multi-model samples
- Model can be derived from Package if needed
**Action**: Document design decision - Package subsumes Models
