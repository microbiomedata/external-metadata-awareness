# group-meetings

notes from group meetings.

SOP:

- create one issue per week
- notes can be taken in the issue during the meeting
- anyone should feel free to add comments to the ticket before, during, or after (not obligatory)
- short bullets preferred
- links to github issues/PRs encouraged (no need to regurgitate - if added as a bullet GH shows the title)
- links to google docs encouraged

Occasionally we have a "deep dive" in place of the regular group meeting, in which a group member discusses a specific topic in more detail.

The deep dives spreadsheet is at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17nmm_3sn5hhTOdr5m05oBaClPjIDrcySRm9uX13ETmw/edit?gid=971857152#gid=971857152
