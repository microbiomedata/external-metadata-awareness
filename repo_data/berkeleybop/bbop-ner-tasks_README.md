# organization

Please read [berkeleybop.org/best_practice](http://berkeleybop.org/best_practice)

See sections:

 - analysis repos
 - NLP
 - Ontologies

Each folder pertains to a subproject

 - each folder should have a README.md
 - each folder should have a Makefile for running the analysis
 - each folder should include input data in the input/ folder
 - if the input data is too large for github, the Makefile should coordinate fetching this
 - the output should be creatable from the inpu
 - include a Dockerfile if complex installation is required
