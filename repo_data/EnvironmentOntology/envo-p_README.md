# envo-p

**This is an experimental ontology with a non-stable namespace! Use at your own risk. If you would like to contribute to this ontology, please contact the developers by filing an issue.**

The purpose of this ontology is to represent parameters and qualities that are tied to environmental materials, dealing with classes like "dissolved organic carbon".

It is not always necessary or desirable to pre-compose all possible classes. For example, "nitrate concentration in soil" can be expressed using CHEBI, PATO, ENVO with appropriate relations: *concentration of* inheres in some *soil* and  *nitrate* (**This formalism needs to be fleshed out**)

What is needed is a represetation of more complex classes like "dissolved organic carbon": that mass of elemental carbon that is part of some environmental material which is either chemically dissolved in that material or exists in particles small enough to pass through a filter. These classes should probably be pre-composed.

Examples of classes to be pre-composed:
- dissolved organic carbon
- particulate organic carbon
- 

Examples of classes that need not be pre-composed:
- nitrate concentration in soil

Situations that need some thought
- Flux
 - measured in an environmental material, but a quality the flowing entity (e.g. a photon)
