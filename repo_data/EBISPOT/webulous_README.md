Webulous
===========

Webulous is a server for creating OWL ontologies from spreadsheets. Webulous provides a repository of ontology templates (or design patterns) that can be populated with data
from spreadsheets. Webulous includes an OPPL (Ontology Pre-Processing Language) server for transforming data collected from templates into an OWL ontology. Webulous also has an accompanying
Google Spreadsheet App (https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/webulous/noieiladpjihajkdgipcmnjcjcgplood), that connects Google Spreadsheets to a Webulous template server.

There's more information about using Webulous available here http://www.ebi.ac.uk/spot/webulous.

 access to a MongoDB database.
