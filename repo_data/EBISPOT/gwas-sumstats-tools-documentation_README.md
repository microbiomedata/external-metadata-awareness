# GWAS SumStats Tools
___

GWAS SumStats Tools is a versatile toolkit created to simplify the processing, validation, and formatting of GWAS summary statistics files intended for submission to the GWAS Catalog. This toolkit provides a variety of features designed for efficiency and ease of use.

## Features
1. Reading: Preview a GWAS summary statistics data file, extract headers, metadata, or specific field-value pairs from the metadata.
2. Formatting: Convert tabular summary statistics files to GWAS Catalog standard format (gwas-ssf), with options for splitting fields, renaming fields, reordering, converting -log (P-value) to normal P-values, handling missing values efficiently and removing comments.
3. Metadata Generation: Automatically generate metadata for a data file from a submission form or create metadata from the GWAS Catalog (for internal use).
4. Validation: Validate the integrity of a summary statistic file using a dynamically generated schema.

## Quick Start

### User-friendly Interface: SSF-morph
If you prefer a user-friendly interface for formatting or validating your data, you can use our online tool. This interface allows you to quickly format or validate individual files with a size limit of 2 GB, all without the need for command-line usage. Simply click **<span style="font-size:1.2em;">[SSF-morph](https://ebispot.github.io/gwas-sumstats-tools-ssf-morph/)</span>** to access the tool and upload your data directly from your local computer.

For instructions on how to use the SSF-morph, please visit our [UI Guide Page](UI_format).

> [!TIP]
> Please note that this interface works with **a single file only** and has a file size limitation of  <span style="font-size:1.2em;">**2GB** </span>. 



### Command Line Interface
However, if you require full access to all functions, or if you need to process larger files or multiple files simultaneously, we recommend using the command-line interface. Please follow the instructions provided here to install and use the command-line tools.

#### Local Installation with pip
Installation requirements: Python  version 3.9 to 3.11.
```bash
$ pip3 install gwas-sumstats-tools

```

If you have a different Python version installed on your local computer and encounter compatibility issues, you can create a virtual environment with Python 3.9. Please follow the instructions [here](install)
