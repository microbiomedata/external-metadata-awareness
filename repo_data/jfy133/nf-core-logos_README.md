# ![nf-core/logos](nf-core-logos/nfcore-logo_logo_light.png#gh-light-mode-only) ![nf-core/logos](nf-core-logos/nfcore-logo_logo_dark.png#gh-dark-mode-only)

A repository for hosting files containing the official [`nf-core` logos and icons](nf-core-logos) in `ai`, `png` and `svg` formats, along with instructions on how to download an `nf-core` logo for your pipeline.

## Download a pipeline logo

From `nf-core/tools v1.7` the pipeline logo in `.png` format will be automatically downloaded and added to the appropriate directories when you run the [`nf-core create`](https://github.com/nf-core/tools#creating-a-new-workflow) command!

However, if you would like to download a logo for any other reason you can simply use a command like the one below:

```bash
curl https://nf-co.re/logo/pipelinename?theme=light --output nfcore-pipelinename_logo_light.png
```

You can create a logo optimized for dark backgrounds by changing the `?theme` flag in the URL above from `light` to `dark`.

Also, you can append the link with URL flags: `?s` and `?w`. The former scales the image to be 400px wide, which is a nice size for including the logo in the pipeline completion email. The latter lets you specify any width you want, e.g. `?w=800` will give you a logo that's `800px` wide. The height of the image is automatically adjusted relative to the width.

Only one resize flag can be given at a time; `?w` takes precedence.

## Font information

If you are as meticulous as we are and would like to use the same fonts and colours for other purposes then you can download [Maven Pro Bold Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Maven+Pro) via you web-browser and install them locally, or if you are running the script in a Linux environment you should be able to do this with the following commands:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.fonts/
cd ~/.fonts/
wget 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/fonts/master/ofl/mavenpro/static/MavenPro-Black.ttf'
wget 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/fonts/master/ofl/mavenpro/static/MavenPro-Bold.ttf'
wget 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/fonts/master/ofl/mavenpro/static/MavenPro-Medium.ttf'
wget 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/fonts/master/ofl/mavenpro/static/MavenPro-Regular.ttf'
```

The green colour in the logo is RGB: `36,176,100` or Hex:`#24B064`.

## Pipeline logo specifications

This repository also includes pipeline logos that have been customised away from the default generated pipeline.

The specifications of the PNG versions of the dark and light versions of each should be:

- Height: 4cm
- Resolution: 300 DPI
