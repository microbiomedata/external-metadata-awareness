# NCBI Gene

| [Documentation](https://monarch-initiative.github.io/ncbi-gene) |

The NCBI Gene integrates information from a wide range of species. A record may include nomenclature, Reference Sequences (RefSeqs), maps, pathways, variations, phenotypes, and links to genome-, phenotype-, and locus-specific resources worldwide.

### Data Sources

- [NCBI bulk downloads](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/)

### Gene Information

Genes for all NCBI species (Dog, Cow, Pig, Chicken, et alia) are loaded using the ingest file (filtered to only NCBI taxon ID).

#### Biolink Captured

- biolink:Gene
  - id
  - symbol
  - description
  - in_taxon
  - in_taxon_label
  - provided_by (["infores:ncbi-gene"])

poetry install
```

> **Note** that the `make install` command is just a convenience wrapper around `poetry install`.

Once installed, you can check that everything is working as expected:

```bash
# Run the pytest suite
make test
# Download the data and run the Koza transform
make download
make run
```

## Usage

To see available options:

```bash
make help
```

### Download and Transform

Download the data for the ncbi_gene transform:

```bash
poetry run ncbi_gene download
```

To run the Koza transform for NCBI Gene:

```bash
poetry run ncbi_gene transform
```

To see available options:

```bash
poetry run ncbi_gene download --help
# or
poetry run ncbi_gene transform --help
```

### Testing

To run the test suite:

```bash
make test
```
