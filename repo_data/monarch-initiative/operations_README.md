# Team operations overview

## Guiding principles/values
These guiding principles are meant to complement any core competencies required by your job description or by your institution.

### 1. Clarity, achievability of goals
- We aim for clear priorities and achievable objectives, both at the level of the team and individuals. If you do not have a good grasp of these for yourself, the most actionable/useful place to start is by enumerating what is on your plate and then asking for help/feedback. At the team level, plans are described on the documents for each Monarch Working Group. 
 
### 2. Flexibility
- We aim to be flexible about *how* goals can be achieved. When it is necessary to change the goals themselves, we aim to do so, mindful of the impacts on other timelines and processes. Part of flexibility is that we aim for humility, recognizing that everyone's job is important and that their perfect work environment and process look a little different from yours.

### 3. Transparency
- We aim for a collaborative and transparent work environment that fosters trust among team members. A key component of transparency is striking the right balance of information that diverse stakeholders need to be effective. Too much information at the wrong level of detail confuses rather than clarifies. Similarly, long lapses between commits or exposure of new work can lead to confusion at best and duplication of work at worst.
- The best forms of documentation allow for nestedness; for executive summaries that can be drilled into if the situation calls for it.
- Any concern that seriously jeopardizes project goals or timelines should be brought to the attention of a PI.

### 4. Willingness to embrace and drive change
- We are at the bleeding edge of informatics innovation, and we are doing this in a non-traditional environment wherein many of us are quasi-remote work. We are all building the car and driving it at the same time; if you have a suggestion for how to make our process work better for you or for anyone, please don't stay silent. Let us know.
- Wherever appropriate, we welcome the opportunity to have post-mortems to improve processes to maximize our impact

### 5. Dedication
- We aim primarily for the success of the project and the team rather than any one person. This may mean that the contributions we make are different from those we would be proud to make with no constraints on our time or resources.
- Roles and experience levels are diverse, but everyone is expected to do their best. Everyone's contribution matters.

### 6. Ownership, initiative, and accountability
 - No one person can be responsible for everything, but everyone must be responsible for something. This distributed ownership is a necessary part of both personal growth and shared success, especially in an entrepreneurial environment such as ours.

## Operationalizing these values
- Pursuant to the above values, here are some of the implications for how we endeavor to work together.

#### GitHub settings
##### Notifications
- The purpose of notifications is to ensure attention. This means that, at a minimum, you should:
  - Have email notifications for all issues/PRs that @mention you, whether or not it is in a repo that you commit to.
  - You can have notifications on for other things as well, provided that they don't compromise your attention to things that involve you.

#### Slack
- All project staff must be on the Monarch Slack. While it need not be set to 'desktop notifications' for every message or for the whole day, you should at least have it configured to send email digests and -- at a minimum -- notifications for all of your @mentions.

#### Email
- If you need action from anyone at the PI level, it is best to email or, if urgent, Skype. If it is in relation to a ticket, please provide a link to the ticket so that the conversation can be better tracked. Give the email an action-oriented title and make it clear what you're asking.
- Team members have different levels of tolerance for email, but outcomes of an email conversation may be appropriate to capture in the issue tracker.

#### Phone/Skype
- In part because this is an international team, and some work from home, we are not really phone users. We tend to use Skype for any ad-hoc 2-3-person meetings or informal chat threads.

#### Communicate and report absences
 - If you are out of the office, let your manager and relevant members of the Monarch team know.

###### Content:
- Each week, comment on your issue in the [operations repo](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/operations/issues).
  - It should be a bulleted list at a high enough level to be useful to PIs but should reference any relevant issues, PRs, or code so that technical members can dig in if needed. It should be given the issue label "weekly update" as well as any other tags relevant to the projects.
  - The contents of the summary should cover:
    - What you did last week (last Thursday to today)
    - What you plan to do the coming week (tomorrow to next Wednesday)
    - Tasks should be closeable within the week and also specific enough to be meaningful. A task called "work on X" is not as meaningful as "complete a draft of x for group review on Thursday".
    - Blockers, concerns, especially anything requiring decision-making by leadership
