# CCPnoteFX
Common-complex disease PhenoteFX is a Java app that is designed to help create and maintain
[Human Phenotype Ontology](https://hpo.jax.org/app/) annotation files for common-complex diseases.

## Requirements
CCPnoteFX requires Java 16 or better.

CCPnoteFX also requires complexphen to be installed (currently, this is only possible locally)
```bazaar
git clone https://github.com/monarch-initiative/complexphen
cd complexphen
mvn install
```

## Installation
We are in the process of refactoring. We need to locally install [fenominal](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/fenominal)
with maven to build PhenoteFX.

## Using CCPnoteFX
Please consult the [documentation](http://phenotefx.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) for 
a tutorial on how to install and use CCPnoteFX.
