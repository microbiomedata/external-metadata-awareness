# Monarch Disease Association Consortium (MDAC)

This repository will contain code to derive disease-to-gene  mappings for Mendelian, digenic, certain chromosomal, cancer, and common disease associations. We will start off with Mendelian associations using files from Entrez Gene. We will add information from Orphanet, Illumina's TruSeq clinical exome panel, and Agilent's clinical exome panel

## The wiki
The wiki for this project has separate pages for the following things that need to be done for the setup

1. Install tomcat7 and integrate it with maven
2. Prepare the files from NCBI repositories
