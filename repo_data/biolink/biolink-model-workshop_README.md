# biolink-model-workshop

This repository contains sample data from the demo presented at the Biolink Model Workshop at Biocuration 2020.


There are 4 folders, each corresponding to a particular data transformation:
- [01-stringdb](01-stringdb) - Modeling interactions from STRING DB
- [02-mapping](02-mapping) - Mapping protein to their corresponding gene
- [03-metadata](03-metadata) - Representing gene with its metadata
- [04-build-the-graph](04-build-the-graph) - Combining all the above to make a graph


The combined graph as TSV and RDF N-Triples can be found in [04-build-the-graph](04-build-the-graph).
