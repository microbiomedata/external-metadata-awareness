complex geodiversity, has been studied extensively regarding its ecotopes 
and threatened ecosystems. However, its microbial diversity still remains 
unexplored.

## 2016: GSC 18 workshop

The GSC18 workshop held on 12 – 15 June 2016 at HCMR/IMBBC for the first 
time included an Island Sampling Day (ISD) event. The main focus of the 
GSC18 meeting was to ‘put standards into action’.


## 2022: ISD Crete 2nd sampling

The ISD Crete 2022 was organised by the HCMR and took place on 13th of July.
The goal was the same as the previous sampling and using the same rootes 
and sampling sites the teams sampled soil from all around Crete.
