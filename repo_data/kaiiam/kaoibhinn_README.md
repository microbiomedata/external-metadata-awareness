## DAW Setup 

### Download and install Reaper

Download and install relevant operating system build from [Reaper download page](https://www.reaper.fm/download.php). [Reaper](https://www.reaper.fm/) is a Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) with an unlimited evaluation license, and open source community contributions. 

### Handling Latency 

Latency is the delay experienced from signal processing and can make it difficult/impossible to play live. The following might help fix latency issues.

* On windows set ASIO drivers (see [How to Fix Latency in REAPER](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JovPorQzzFs))
* Possibly reduce `Media Buffer Size` to something like `200` ms in `Reaper Preferences > Audio > Buffering`. This helps reduce latency with live effect processing.
* Possibly set a manual buffer adjustment (e.g. `17` ms) in `Reaper Preferences > settings> audio > Recording`
* Possibly change the `Request block size` (e.g. `64` ms down from default of 512) in `Reaper Preferences > Audio > Device`.

### Download plugins

* `VST3: NeuralAmpModeler (Steven Atkinson)` from [here](https://github.com/sdatkinson/NeuralAmpModelerPlugin)
* `VST3: TDR Nova (Tokyo Dawn Labs)` from [here](https://www.tokyodawn.net/tdr-nova/)

Restart `Reaper` after installation. Neither `NeuralAmpModeler` nor `TDR Nova` require anything (like paying or making a username/password) to download.
