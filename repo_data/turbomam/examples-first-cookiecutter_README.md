## Standard Protocol

### Step 1: Create a virtual environment

Create a Python virtual environment.
You can read [this guide](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/)
to learn more about them and how to create one. We suggest using poetry, but
you can use any tool you like. Please note, most LinkML tools work best in
Python 3.8 or higher.

An example using poetry:

```bash
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
```

```bash
mkdir linkml-projects
cd linkml-projects
poetry init # creates a new poetry project with pyproject.toml
            # Note this is not a new linkml project,
            # it is just a virtual environment to install cruft.
poetry add click==8.1.3  # this creates your virtual environment.
```

Add `poetry-dynamic-versioning` as a plugin

```bash
poetry self add "poetry-dynamic-versioning[plugin]"
```

### Step 2: Install the cruft tool in your virtual environment

This tool will help you keep your project up to date with the latest LinkML
tools and best practices.

In your poetry virtual environment:

```bash
poetry shell
poetry add cruft
```

_At this point, you can create any number of Examples-first LinkML repos in your linkml-projects directory. 
There's generally no need to repeat the steps up to this point on any given computer._

### Step 3:  Use cruft to create your brand new LinkML project

In your poetry virtual environment:

```bash
cruft create https://github.com/turbomam/examples-first-cookiecutter
```

You will be prompted for a few values.  The defaults are fine for most
projects, but do name your project something that makes sense to you!
The interactive session will guide you through the process:

- `project_name`: Name of the project, use kebab-case with no spaces.
  Suggestions:
  - `patient-observation-schema`
  - `sample-collection-metadata`
  - `resume-standard`
- `project_description`: Description of the project.
  - A single brief sentence is recommended
  - Can easily be modified later
- `full_name`: Your name
- `email`: your email
- `main_schema_class`:
  - This is used to generate an example schema which you can edit
  - The value of this field is ignored if this is a schemasheets project
  - You can always change this later
    - Examples: `Person`, `Observation`, `Sample`, `Entry`, `Gene`, `Event`
- `create_python_project`
  - If "Yes", set this up as a python project
  - Select Yes if you want to make data classes that can be used by developers
- `use_schemasheets`
  - If "Yes", set this to obtain your schema from
    [schemasheets](https://linkml.io/schemasheets)
- `google_sheet_id`
  - Ignore/use default value if answer to previous question was "No"
  - If you are using schemasheets then enter your google doc ID here
  - If you like you can leave the default value, and this will use the demo
    schema
- `google_sheet_tabs`
  - Ignore/use default value if not using schemasheets
  - If you are using schemasheets, enter a space-separated list of tabs
  - your tabs in your sheet MUST NOT have spaces in them
- `github_token_for_pypi_deployment`:
  - The github token name which aligns with your autogenerated PyPI token for
    making releases.
  - This helps automated releases to PyPI
  - This should be ignored if this is not a python project
  - Even if this is a python project, you can leave blank and fill in later

This will generate the project folder abiding by the template configuration
specified by `linkml-project-cookiecutter` in the
[`cookiecutter.json`](https://github.com/linkml/linkml-project-cookiecutter/blob/main/cookiecutter.json)
file.

This will generate the project folder very similar to what is mentioned in the
[linkml-project-template](https://github.com/linkml/linkml-project-template)
project.

For more docs, see
[linkml/linkml-project-cookiecutter](https://github.com/linkml/linkml-project-cookiecutter).

### Step 4: Setup the LinkML project

Optionally set project generation environment variables
(see `gen-doc --help` and `gen-project --help`):

```bash
export LINKML_COOKIECUTTER_GEN_DOC_ARGS=--no-mergeimports      # example
export LINKML_COOKIECUTTER_GEN_PROJECT_ARGS=--no-mergeimports  # example
```

Change to the folder your generated project is in

```bash
cd my-awesome-schema  # using the folder example above
make setup
```

### Step 5: Edit the schema

Edit the schema (the .yaml file) in the
`linkml-projects/my-awesome-schema/src/my_awesome_schema/schema` folder

```bash
nano src/my_awesome_schema/schema/my_awesome_schema.yaml
```

### Step 6: Validate the schema

```bash
make test
```

### Step 7: Auto-generate your documentation locally

LinkML generates schema documenation automatically. Step 7 here, allows you to
preview the documentation that LinkML generates before pushing to GitHub.
Note, this template comes with GitHub Actions that autogenerate this
documentation on release of your schema repository at a URL like this one:
[https://my-user-or-organization.github.io/my-awesome-schema/]

```bash
make serve
```

### Step 8: Create a github project

1. Go to [https://github.com/new] and follow the instructions, being sure to
   NOT add a README or .gitignore file (this cookiecutter template will take
   care of this for you). 
   
   - Make sure the ownership of your new GitHub project is set to the user or organization you prefer
   - Add a Repository name (presumably the same as the `project_name` above)
   - Add a Description (presumably the same as the `project_description` above)
   - Click "Create repository"
   

2. Add the remote to your local git repository

   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/my-user-or-organization/my-awesome-schema.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Step 9: Deploy documentation

`make deploy`

### Step 10: Register the schema

See [How to register a schema](../faq/contributing)

## Keeping your project up to date

In order to be up-to-date with the template, first check if there is a mismatch
between the project's boilerplate code and the template by running:

```bash
poetry shell
cruft check
```

This indicates if there is a difference between the current project's
boilerplate code and the latest version of the project template. If the project
is up-to-date with the template:

```output
SUCCESS: Good work! Project's cruft is up to date and as clean as possible :).
```

Otherwise, it will indicate that the project's boilerplate code is not
up-to-date by the following:

```output
FAILURE: Project's cruft is out of date! Run `cruft update` to clean this mess up.
```

For viewing the difference, run `cruft diff`. This shows the difference between
the project's boilerplate code and the template's latest version.

After running `cruft update`, the project's boilerplate code will be updated to
the latest version of the template.
