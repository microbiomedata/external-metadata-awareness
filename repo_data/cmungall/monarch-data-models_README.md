This repository contains documentation on the abstract data model used
in the Monarch project to represent phenotypes and associated
entities.

Modules are expressed as UML diagrams. It is a refence model: these
are not intended to be turned directly in object-oriented
classes. Different formats and representations can be derived from
this. For example, a phenopacket format could be mapped to this.

Note on relationship to ontology modeling: Monarch primarily relies on
ontology modeling, expressing knowledge and data as RDF/OWL. However,
sometimes it is necessary to express things as conventional
object-oriented information models.
