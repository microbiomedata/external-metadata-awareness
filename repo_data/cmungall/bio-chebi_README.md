# bio-chebi

NOT YET IN PRODUCTION

This repo will replace the current bio-chebi builds in the GO svn repo - see https://github.com/geneontology/go-ontology/issues/12211

There are two main products:

 * substance-by-role.{obo,owl}
 * bio-chebi.owl

Note these are *NOT* to be deposited in this repository. Instead they will be built by jenkins, deployed on S3/Cloudfront, and made available via purls with the prefix http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/go/chebi/
