# LinkML rendering of CFDE datamodel

__EXPERIMENTAL__

This is an experimental rendering of the Common Fund Data Ecosystem (CFDE) datamodel into [LinkML](https://linkml.io)

This is currently ENTIRELY automated - no additional curation is done on the schema

1. Download frictionless schema from https://osf.io/c63aw/
2. Run [schema-automator](https://github.com/linkml/schema-automator)
3. Deploy using standard LinkML template
