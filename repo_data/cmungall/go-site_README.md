A collection of tools and files associated with the GO public website
and geneontology.org web presence.

Every directory should have its own description.

* drupal7

  The files that we're using tp modify our Drupal 7 installation from
  stock. This may also serve as a base for when we push onto a
  service.

* cgi-bin

  This files an scripts that we want to preserve from the old GO site.
  Ideally, any critical functionality can be rewritten in a simpler
  and more reusable way than the original.

* metadata

  The location of all core GO-related metadata. Most notably
  db-xrefs.yaml.
  
* scripts
