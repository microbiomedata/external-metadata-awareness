Here is a small data set of dinosaur biotic interactions documented by physical evidence in the fossil record, e.g., stomach contents, tooth marks.  These data are for import to http://globalbioticinteractions.org.  In addition to the standard columns from the original template, there are a couple of new columns:

1. targetTaxonLifeStage, which should map to http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/lifeStage in the Darwin Core occurrences extension, with values from PATO
2. MeasurementRemarks, which should map to http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/measurementRemarks in the Darwin Core measurements or facts extension

@jhpoelen Let me know if there is anything else you need to process this data set.
