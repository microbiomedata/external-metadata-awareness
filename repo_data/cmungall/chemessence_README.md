# ChemEssence Ontology

This repo contains the pipeline for creating the CHEMESSENCE ontology.

Please read and understand the slide deck [simplifying
CHEBI](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1R3NRzH70ERjwebqecgt2OYKC8sIuB1_Xs7ENyWAXgjc/edit#slide=id.g2e88609578d_0_6)
before using this.

__WARNING__ this ontology **relabels** and **rewires** CHEBI in order
to make a simpler subset. If you don't know what this means, don't use
this. You have been warned!
