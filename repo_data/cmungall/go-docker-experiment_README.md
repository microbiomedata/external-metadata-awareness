EXPERIMENT!

Proof-of-concept of using docker-compose plus minimal modular Dockerfiles for loading an AmiGO instance.

See Makefile for details.

You need docker and docker-compose installed.

You should be able to just do

```
make load
```

This will give you a solr server plus a dump of the index from a docker volume
