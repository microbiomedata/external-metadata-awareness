Experiments with Allen cell API

See http://alleninstitute.github.io/AllenSDK/cell_types.html

The main goal was to see if it was possible to extract the taxonomy from the API; this appears not to be possible

cell-types.json is the export from the API, but this is a misnomer as it's not strictly the types
