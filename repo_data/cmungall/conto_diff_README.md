# ContoDiff
This project is the implementation of the ContoDiff approach enabling the diff computation for two ontology versions. The realization is based on a local h2 database for managing the two versions. The result is an evolution mapping consisting of additions, deletions, and changes of concepts, relationships, and attributes. Moreover, the method determines a complex diff regarding the basic diff. You can find more information in the following publication:
