There are two issues: first, that URL currently doesn't resolve to anything because GitHub made private repos (such as this one) ineligible for hosting GitHub Pages sites. Second, if we simply made this repo public again, the `gh-pages` branch currently holds a bunch of old, outdated auto-generated schema docs.\r\n\r\nThese changes replace the old, outdated auto-generated schema docs in the `gh-pages` branch with an HTML-file redirect to https://microbiomedata.github.io/nmdc-schema/. \r\n\r\nOnce these changes are merged two things need to happen:\r\n\r\n* A repo admin needs to make this repo public again (or give me admin privileges to do the same)\r\n* I will go into the `main` branch and remove the workflow file that publishes to GitHub Pages so that the redirect isn't accidentally overwritten if someone happens to push changes to this repo in the future",
