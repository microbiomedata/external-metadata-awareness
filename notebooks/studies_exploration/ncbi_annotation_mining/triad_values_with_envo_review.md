Here’s what I noticed from scanning through the sample of values containing “envo.” These definitely illustrate the
patterns you anticipated, and there are a few additional twists as well:

1. **CURIE-like strings in a “correct” or nearly correct ENVO format**
    - Many entries use the “ENVO:00000000” style (7 or 8 digits). For example:
        - `terrestrial biome [ENVO:00000446]`
        - `ENVO:01000024`
        - `ENVO:00005774`
        - `soil ENVO:00001998`  

2. **Underscores or other substitutions instead of a colon**
    - Some values replace the colon with an underscore (or occasionally drop in extra punctuation/spaces). For example:
        - `ENVO_00001998`
        - `ENVO_00000020`
        - `ENVO.00002150` (a period instead of a colon)  

3. **Square brackets, parentheses, or other separators around CURIEs**
    - You see CURIEs wrapped in square brackets, parentheses, or both:
        - `feces [ENVO:00002003]`
        - `cultivated habitat(ENVO:00000113)`
        - `garden[ENVO:00000011]; field[ENVO:00000114]`
        - `marine coral reef biome(ENVO:01000049)`  

    - The spacing and punctuation are not consistent—some have a space before the bracket, some do not, some put the
      CURIE in parentheses while the label remains outside, etc.

4. **Multiple annotations delimited in one value**
    - There are several examples with semicolons, pipes, slashes, or just raw adjacency:
        - `soil [ENVO:00001998]; autoclaved sand`
        - `ocean biome / ENVO:01000048`
        - `saline marsh [ENVO:00000054], biofilm [ENVO:00002034]`  

    - You mentioned pipe-delimited samples like `soil [ENVO:1234567] | water [ENVO:5555555]`; I do see semicolons,
      commas, and slashes used similarly in this data.

5. **“ENVO:” preceding a label rather than a numeric ID**
    - Some lines have “ENVO:” plus a textual phrase, without a standard numeric code. For example:
        - `ENVO:human-associated habitat`
        - `ENVO:marine biome`
        - `ENVO:anthropogenic habitat`
        - `ENVO:feces`  

    - This aligns with your note that sometimes “ENVO:” is stuck onto a label instead of an ID.

6. **Potential accidental “incrementing” of digits**
    - You mentioned seeing runs like `soil [ENVO:1234567]`, `soil [ENVO:1234568]`, `soil [ENVO:1234569]`; indeed there
      are multiple similar lines that differ by a single digit in the ID. For example, I see repeated “soil” or
      “rhizosphere” lines with IDs that are very close to each other:
        - `pasture soil ENVO:00005773`
        - `grassland soil ENVO:00005750`
        - `field soil (ENVO:00005755)`
        - etc.  

    - Not always obviously consecutive, but it’s typical to see many near-adjacent IDs that might come from spreadsheet
      “drag-to-fill” errors.

7. **Placeholders or incomplete IDs**
    - There are examples like `root matter [ENVO:requested]`, which seems to be a placeholder where a real ID was not
      filled in.
    - Also, “ENVO: 02000049” (with extra whitespace) or “EnvO:water” (capitalization or partial mismatch) can appear.  

8. **Other interesting patterns**
    - **Mix of multiple ontologies**: Some lines have “TAIR:0000027,” “UBERON_0001153,” or references to “Longhurst
      2007,” indicating more than just ENVO was being used in the same annotation.
    - **Punctuation or free text appended**: Some lines look like “Freshwater biome. ENVO:00000873” or “Human-associated
      habitat; ENVO:00009003” with punctuation spliced into the same field.
    - **Standalone CURIE**: A few lines are just `[ENVO:00002113]` or `[ENVO:02000049]` with no label at all.

Overall, it does indeed match the patterns you described:

- Correct/near-correct CURIEs.
- “ENVO:” preceding either a numeric ID or a label.
- Square brackets, parentheses, semicolons, commas, pipes, or slashes used inconsistently.
- Potentially accidental ID increments.
- Multiple environment references crammed into one value.
- Placeholders or partial attempts at an ID.
- Non-ENVO ontologies mixing in.

These variations seem mostly due to (1) different user habits when entering the data, (2) spreadsheet or auto-fill
accidents, (3) differences in how people interpret “ENVO:” as prefix vs. label, and (4) attempts to combine multiple
environment descriptors in a single field.
