In a global collaborative effort involving five laboratories, we aimed to advance reproducibility in microbiome studies by leveraging recently developed fabricated ecosystems (EcoFAB 2.0).

All participating laboratories replicated permutation-dependent changes in plant phenotype, root exudates, and bacterial community structure. Additionally, we identified factors determining bacterial colonization patterns through comparative genomics of SynCom members, fluorescent microscopy, motility assays, and exudate utilization. The study provides benchmark datasets and detailed protocols to achieve reproducibility and best practices, demonstrating how standardized SynComs and EcoFAB can promote scientific collaboration, improve comparability, and accelerate the application of findings, thus enhancing our understanding of microbiomes in plant and ecosystem science.

Members of the soil microbiome (bacteria, archaea, fungi, microfauna, and viruses) play key roles in soil carbon turnover and the stabilization of persistent organic matter via their metabolic activities, cellular biochemistry, and extracellular products. Soils store more carbon than the atmosphere and biosphere combined, yet the mechanisms that regulate soil carbon remain elusive. Microbial residues are a primary ingredient in soil organic matter (SOM), a pool that is critical to agriculture, healthy ecosystems, and Earth\u2019s climate.","ecosystem":null,"ecosystem_category":null,"ecosystem_subtype":null,"ecosystem_type":null,"funding_sources":"The U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research (BER) under contract DE-AC52- 07NA27344.","gnps_task_identifiers":null,"gold_study_identifiers":null,"homepage_website":null,"insdc_bioproject_identifiers":null,"jgi_portal_study_identifiers":null,"name":null,"notes":null,"part_of":null,"principal_investigator.email":null,"principal_investigator.has_raw_value":"Jennifer Pett-Ridge","principal_investigator.name":"Jennifer Pett-Ridge","principal_investigator.orcid":"orcid:0000-0002-4439-2398","principal_investigator.profile_image_url":"https:\/\/portal.nersc.gov\/project\/m3408\/profile_images\/pett-ridge_jennifer.jpg","protocol_link":null,"specific_ecosystem":null,"study_category":"research_study","study_image":null,"title":"Microbes Persist Science Focus Area","websites":"https:\/\/sc-programs.llnl.gov\/biological-and-environmental-research-at-llnl\/soil-microbiome"}

The interactions among soil microbial communities, N availability, and Miscanthus \u00d7 giganteus and management may explain changes in plant productivity. In this study, soil samples from different stand ages of Miscanthus \u00d7 giganteus in a replicated chronosequence field trial were used to investigate the effects of stand age and N fertilizer rates on microbial community structure. We hypothesized that there is a definable Miscanthus \u00d7 giganteus soil microbiome and that this community varies significantly with stand age and fertilization. Our results showed that the main phyla in soil microbial communities, regardless of plant age, are similar but microbial community structures are significantly different. The variation in observed microbial communities generally decreases with older stand ages. The amount of N fertilizer applied also affected the microbial community structure associated with different aged Miscanthus \u00d7 giganteus. Specifically, the relative abundance of Proteobacteria (Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria) and Acidobacteria (subgroup Gp1) increased shortly after fertilization and was more associated with younger Miscanthus \u00d7 giganteus. Furthermore, our results show a significant relationship between bacterial \u03b1 diversity and fertilization rates and that this response is also affected by stand age. Overall, our results emphasize linkages between microbial community structure, plant age, and fertilization in Miscanthus \u00d7 giganteus.","ecosystem":null,"ecosystem_category":null,"ecosystem_subtype":null,"ecosystem_type":null,"funding_sources":null,"gnps_task_identifiers":null,"gold_study_identifiers":null,"homepage_website":null,"insdc_bioproject_identifiers":null,"jgi_portal_study_identifiers":null,"name":"The Impact of Stand Age and Fertilization on the Soil Microbiome of Miscanthus \u00d7 giganteus","notes":null,"part_of":"nmdc:sty-11-3cmn1g53","principal_investigator.email":"adina@iastate.edu","principal_investigator.has_raw_value":null,"principal_investigator.name":"Adina Howe","principal_investigator.orcid":"0000-0002-7705-343X","principal_investigator.profile_image_url":"https:\/\/portal.nersc.gov\/project\/m3408\/submission_data\/2636d9c2-0af6-4781-b35d-0bc09177ab66\/pi_profile_image.png","protocol_link":null,"specific_ecosystem":null,"study_category":"research_study","study_image":null,"title":"The Impact of Stand Age and Fertilization on the Soil Microbiome of Miscanthus \u00d7 giganteus","websites":"https:\/\/www.germslab.org\/research\/"}
