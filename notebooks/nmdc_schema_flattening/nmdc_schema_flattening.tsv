Biosample	ecosystem											The abiotic factors play a profound role on the type and composition of organisms in a given environment. The GOLD Ecosystem at the top of the five-level classification system is aimed at capturing the broader environment from which an organism or environmental sample is collected. The three broad groups under Ecosystem are Environmental, Host-associated, and Engineered. They represent samples collected from a natural environment or from another organism or from engineered environments like bioreactors respectively.		An ecosystem is a combination of a physical environment (abiotic factors) and all the organisms (biotic factors) that interact with this environment.

Study	ecosystem											The abiotic factors play a profound role on the type and composition of organisms in a given environment. The GOLD Ecosystem at the top of the five-level classification system is aimed at capturing the broader environment from which an organism or environmental sample is collected. The three broad groups under Ecosystem are Environmental, Host-associated, and Engineered. They represent samples collected from a natural environment or from another organism or from engineered environments like bioreactors respectively.		An ecosystem is a combination of a physical environment (abiotic factors) and all the organisms (biotic factors) that interact with this environment. Ecosystem is in position 1/5 in a GOLD path.								gold_path_field												string				https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/help							
Study	ecosystem_category											The Environmental ecosystem (for example) is divided into Air, Aquatic and Terrestrial. Ecosystem categories for Host-associated samples can be individual hosts or phyla and for engineered samples it may be manipulated environments like bioreactors, solid waste etc.		Ecosystem categories represent divisions within the ecosystem based on specific characteristics of the environment from where an organism or sample is isolated. Ecosystem category is in position 2/5 in a GOLD path.								gold_path_field												string				https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/help							
Study	ecosystem_subtype											Ecosystem Type Marine (Environmental -> Aquatic -> Marine) is further divided (for example) into Intertidal zone, Coastal, Pelagic, Intertidal zone etc. in the Ecosystem subtype category.		Ecosystem subtypes represent further subdivision of Ecosystem types into more distinct subtypes. Ecosystem subtype is in position 4/5 in a GOLD path.								gold_path_field												string				https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/help							
Study	ecosystem_type											The Aquatic ecosystem category (for example) may have ecosystem types like Marine or Thermal springs etc. Ecosystem category Air may have Indoor air or Outdoor air as different Ecosystem Types. In the case of Host-associated samples, ecosystem type can represent Respiratory system, Digestive system, Roots etc.		Ecosystem types represent things having common characteristics within the Ecosystem Category. These common characteristics based grouping is still broad but specific to the characteristics of a given environment. Ecosystem type is in position 3/5 in a GOLD path.								gold_path_field												string				https://gold.jgi.doe.gov/help
