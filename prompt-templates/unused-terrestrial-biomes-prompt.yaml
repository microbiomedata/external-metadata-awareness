  - prompt: Here are the EnvO biomes that are included in my project's soil biome enumeration. A header line is included.

  - prompt: Here is a table of relationships between the Environment Ontology biomes and other classes.
      Subclass relationships are transitive.

question: Write a Python script to answer the following questions...
  How many non-aquatic biomes are there? How many biomes are included in the enumeration?
  How many non-aquatic biomes are not included in the enumeration? List them as bare CURIes.
  Whats the mean and the standard deviation of lengths of the enum-included biome labels,
  and the lengths of the enum-excluded biome labels?
